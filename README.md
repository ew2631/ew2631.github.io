## chapter iv &mdash; biking | 2025/04/03
<br>
<br>
hi pals,
<br>
<br>
in taipei, public bikes are ubiquitiously available and free for the first 30min of the ride. it's taken me some time to figure out the best biking blueprint - where to avoid the uneven sidewalks and make the right turns onto bikepaths hidden in the center dividers. it's the best way to live and breathe the city while being a part of it. being familiar with a place means knowing what side of the street to be on. 

<br>
<br>

in taipei, the crosswalks take a notoriously long time. if you miss a light, it could cost you anywhere from 30 secs to 5 minutes. when making certain turns, riding in the direction opposite to foot traffic means you can avoid an extra street crossing. if there's very few people around, the main question is -- are you willing to go against the flow? and let people watch while you do it?

my move to taiwan has felt like a contant ride on the opposite side of the road. every so often, another passerby will give me that look - why did you come all the way to Asia, when everyone is still trying to go to the West? The self-assurance that I knew why I came here and the belief I could handle this life, in that moment, weakens.

It can't be left unsaid that this underlying conundrum is largely impacted - but not entirely caused - by my new and undeniably stressful job. I had the opportunity to take a really challenging role where I knew I would both learn and struggle tremendously, and I have. I'm in the uphill part of the ride, so most days are just pushing the pedal one more time. other days, I get off the bike entirely and rest. the job isn't only you and you are not only your job. 

so if you're going to ride on the wrong side of the street, it's best to just focus on the road ahead. you're the only one who needs to know where you're going anyways :)

always my best,

emily

## chapter iii &mdash; living life impromptu | 2024/07/19
<br>
<br>
hi pals,
<br>
<br>
as an expat, it’s natural for locals and expats alike to ask you the same question: why did you come to taipei? for a while, I felt dissatisfied with my own response, a disorganized ramble about my familial roots and hopes of learning mandarin. sometimes, i'd add the context that I was in between jobs at the time and feeling lukewarm about the bicoastal migration all my friends and their friends do in their 20s. the moving backdrop of these conversations included traveling back to california and hong kong for work while actively integrating with an incredibly diverse social ecosystem here. finally, while spacing out in my favorite local coffee shop one night, the real answer came to me, short and bittersweet. I left because I had no reason to stay.
<br>
<br>

it is a painful admission, and I hope it’s not perceived as a personal critique of any or all of you. if know me, you know that my adventurous, carefree persona is preceded by someone far more risk-averse and committed-oriented. she would never choose an exciting and transient lifestyle over a community built around shared interests, social purpose rooted in deep relationships or even, dare I admit, the right life partner. before leaving, I had none of those things. 


after the move, three things have became clear- ***one:*** I’m currently in the emotional state and age where I want relationships of depth. as difficult as those are to cultivate from scratch here, my closest friends were already randomly scattered across the states and I was as single there as I am here. there was no opportunity cost to leaving, only a chance to find what I was looking for in a more unexpected place.  

***two:*** actively searching for a boyfriend feels...not right. a relationship doesn’t feel wrong - I’ve dated here with varying degrees of failure and come away each time knowing that I always was and still am a monogamist. but the dating chase feels too, one dimensional? I get to know mr. guy with the only intention of dating and if that doesn’t pan out, the likelihood that we both are emotionally mature and invested enough (but not too much) to parlay this into a friendship is like, none? I’m not a fan of putting in an emily-level of effort to know someone when the life expectancy of the connection is shorter than single use plastic. It’s just a bit sad, no? more thoughts to come on this...maybe ;)

***three:*** while I am emotionally untethered, I am also free. among my flawed strengths, I am a maximalist who recognizes that this is the time to embody the alt-Emily as freely and selfishly as I want. I’m many things in adulthood that I never was as my younger self: daring, feminine, free(er) spirited. I can go camping with my male friend and not worry about jealousy issues from a boyfriend I don’t have. I can dress up without wondering if my choices were swayed more by my partner's physical preferences than my own. I can travel anywhere, anytime without the guilt of leaving someone behind. 

for now, I've decided not to do the last one. I like traveling, but I love it when it’s scarce and in good company. instead, I’ve invested in mandarin classes that require in-person attendance starting at 8am. every day. putting down roots takes longer than a good vacation story does because it lasts longer. improving my language skills is mundane and humbling but brings color to my daily life.

in retrospect, I can now accept that my first attempt at adulting left me unfulfilled and wanting. so that’s the other reason I’m here. I’m looking forward with none of the answers in hand, living life impromptu.

always my best,

emily

*p.s. the last phrase sounded strange so I asked chatgpt how to use the right version of the word in the wrong context. I still take all the novelty credit, tis a cute catchphrase~*

## chapter ii &mdash; ~~do the job~~       tricks of the lonely trade | 2024/03/25

hi pals,
<br>
<br>
when I was decided taipei was the next step, the goal was to secure a real job before the move, although I was deeply flattered by those who thought I had the nerve to come just to \~find myself\~ (thanks ethan). in a double edged fashion, my job has been calm and uneventful so far. unfortunately, there's nothing worse than the dreaded \*free time\* when you've caught a bad case of the lonelies. 

I'm not homesick for places, just people. I miss familiar faces who know what I need and what kind of person I'm striving to be. I miss using the full evocative power of language available only to true native speakers. every day is a game of comparison, how this or that is different from my experiential baseline. with only unknowns outside my door, I miss knowing how to even start my day.
 
thankfully, I've already climbed the deepest valleys of this discomfort and can see ridges on the happier horizon. I didn't want to put y'all through the worst of my woes (oh yea I can get even more drAmaTic) so thanks for waiting for me on the other side. now that we're here, I'm happy to share some tricks of the lonely trade:

***eat, exercise, eat better:*** exercise helps you viscerally understand how shitty you’ve been to your body. it’s a great motivator for eating healthy because you more immediately feel the benefits of thankless self-deprivation. developing these habits together is also very time intensive and cuts down on that pesky free time you want to avoid.

***other world immersion:*** in loneliness we often dwell, making it feel that much longer. being in your own head can actually be an amazing thing, especially with the help of video games, reading, art making&mdash; anything that requires active participation. I took the sci-fi route and learned a lil something about cosmic sociology. as the kids say, if you know ya know #darkforest

***scenery with a soundtrack:*** find nature, a landscape where life actively hums in the background-less desert vibes and more running water, thick foliage, oh shit it’s a squirrel vibes. even if you're alone, being a dot in a living macbook background feels less lonesome and more peaceful. spend one day somewhere like this, and you'll find that inflection point.

disclaimer: I took my advice roughly 2/3 of the time. the YouTube algo sedated me the rest of the time with wild cooking reels and John Oliver rants ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I’m only human my friends.

always my best,

emily

## chapter i &mdash; create the vision | 2024/01/21
<br>
<br>

<p align="center">

<br>

hi pals,
<br>
<br>

time to slip on those NB sneakers and a black turtleneck&mdash; we must enter the reality distortion field. every visionary inevitably sees the limits of the West \*sigh\* and travels East to evolve. Steve Jobs, Alexander the Great, even Kanye has a Japanese inspired living room. I'm in good company, no? 

the vision: to find my other half. women love to multi-task, especially with self-identities. this other half, she embodies a contrasting but complimentary persona: more discerning with her words (bc she knows fewer in Mandarin) and careful with her actions (bc it's harder for foreigners to get out of jail).

she knows how to do the *real* job: a balancing act of maximizing the 9 to 6* and minimizing unhealthy association of work to self-worth. this job, this career is not the forever goal&mdash; I've got some soul searching to do before I commit to the career bit. 

she honestly feels a bit vain. great style never hurt a (wo)man, but overvaluing appearance-yours and others-is akin to worshipping fruit: the outside wrinkles first then the inside rots too.** I don't want to hate myself for wanting to be attractive, just to enjoy it while it lasts? because...it won't D: 

hopefully, she meets friends who show her what it truly means to be Taiwanese. she finds a few local haunts where generous aunties know her by name. she discovers a seaside town or natural wonder that she'll revisit with the future kids. husband optional, but preferred. altogether, she'll find a part of this island to call home.

so why the reality distortion field? this all seems cute n' cozy, quite doable. but pursuing new lanes of self-discovery is the gateway drug to both chaos and progress:

>_maybe i really can't do the job and leave the career for good_
>
>_my vanity finsta spirals into a self-obsessed influencer identity_
>
>_bartending on weekends leads to indulging on expensive spirits and even more expensive men_
>
>_I become a [kawaii girl](https://www.ibentoy.com/blog/kawaii-drawings)...?! (alright now we're being a bit absurd >.<)_


the decision tree permutations are endless.  

if you're a returning reader, you'll remember that I had a shite 2023. so I've decided that when life gives you lemons...question everything.

always my best,

emily

## prologue | 2024/01/06
<br>
<p align="center"><em>the following letter has been modified from its original version. it has been formatted to fit a mobile screen.</em></p>
<br>
hi pals,
<br>
<br>

please know that this ~~email~~ letter is a rarely vulnerable moment from a publicly insensitive boomer so pls handle with care. I'm old and emotionally fragile. 

I'm reaching out because 

a) I've appreciated the depth+dimension of our conversations but 

b) I'm moving far away so 

c) I want to try my best to keep having them. 

the hope is that you'll resonate with my updates and respond, rather than the random "how are you?—>(not) too many updates" texting game while we're oceans apart. feel free to reply any way-writing, voice memo, pitch black video taken in an unidentifiable alley. I'm game. hope you'll come along for the ride? I can start. 

I'm moving to taipei in a week. I've gotten different reactions to the news: 

>_whoaaa...that's wild bro_
>
>_That's huge! I'm so excited for you._
>
>_Are you sure? Why?_
>
>_You don't have any clue what you're doing._
>
>_Oh wow, I had no idea. When are you leaving?_

this isn't arbitrary noise; it's the response from the people I've most wanted (and needed) to update. I’ve intentionally blocked most of it out because for me, this is **point blank** the most consequential and least calculated decision I've made in my life. y'all know how I love to Calculate. Evaluate. Predict. but after the 2023 I've had, I laugh (helplessly) at the concept of controlling your life. To self-dictate one's future is not only an absurd ideal but an unactualized** way of living.

the thing is, I already miss my american homies - the day onesies, the close classmates, and the fascinating introspectators** who I’ve found and kept close. I'll need your trans-pacific visits, stateside updates, and virtual hugs. it's quite lonely where I'm going, at least for a while.

I'm excited to meet my other half: the emily who can speak fluent mandarin with sarcastic undertones and knows how to attract rather than approach. I'm just as excited to share her along the way - with you. I actually think this software update is going to be a good one.

always my best,

emily 

*\*\*I love when I make up believable words, don't you? reply with your favorite emilyism*
