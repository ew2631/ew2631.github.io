### prologue

>_the following letter has been modified from its original version. it has been formatted to fit a mobile screen._ 

hi friends,

please know that this ~~email~~ letter is a rarely vulnerable moment from a publicly insensitive boomer. so pls handle with care-im old and emotionally fragile. 
i'm reaching out because 

a) i've appreciated the depth+dimension of our conversations but 

b) i'm moving far away so 

c) i want to try my best to keep having them. 

the hope is that you'll resonate with my updates and respond, rather than the random "how are you?—>(not) too many updates" texting game while we're oceans apart. feel free to reply any way-writing, voice memo, pitch black video taken in an unidentifiable alley. im game. hope you'll come along for the ride? i can start. 

i'm moving to taipei in a week. i've gotten different reactions to the news: 

>_whoaaa...that's wild bro_
>
>_That's huge! I'm so excited for you._
>
>_Are you sure? Why?_
>
>_You don't have any clue what you're doing._
>
>_Oh wow, I had no idea. When are you leaving?_

this isn't arbitrary noise; it's the response from the people i've most wanted (and needed) to update. it's a mixed bag and i’ve intentionally blocked most of it out. because for me, this is **point blank** the most consequential and least calculated decision i've made in my life. y'all know how i love to Calculate. Evaluate. Predict. but after the 2023 I've had, i laugh (helplessly) at the concept of control. To self-dictate one's future is not only an absurd ideal but an unactualized** way of living.

the thing is, i already miss my american homies - the day onesies, the close classmates, and the fascinating introspectators** who i’ve found and kept close. i'll need your trans-pacific visits, stateside updates, and virtual hugs. it's quite lonely where i'm going-at least for a while.

but i'm excited to meet my other half: the emily who can speak fluent mandarin with sarcastic undertones and knows how to attract rather than approach. i'm just as excited to share her along the way -with you. i actually think this software update is going to be a good one.

always my best,

emily 

**i love when i make up believable words, don't you? reply with your favorite emilyism
