hi pals,
<br>

time to slip on those NB sneakers and a black turtleneck&mdash; we must enter the reality distortion field. every visionary inevitably sees the limits of the West \*sigh\* and travels East to evolve. Steve Jobs, Alexander the Great, even Kanye has a Japanese inspired living room. I'm in good company, no? 

the vision: to find my other half. women love to multi-task, especially with self-identities. this other half, she embodies a contrasting but complimentary persona: more discerning with her words (bc she knows fewer in Mandarin) and careful with her actions (bc it's harder for foreigners to get out of jail).

she knows how to do the *real* job: a balancing act of maximizing the 9 to 6* and minimizing unhealthy association of work to self-worth. this job, this career is not the forever goal&mdash; I've got some soul searching to do before I commit to the career bit. 

she honestly feels a bit vain. great style never hurt a (wo)man, but overvaluing appearance-yours and others-is akin to worshipping fruit: the outside wrinkles first then the inside rots too.** I don't want to hate myself for wanting to be attractive, just to enjoy it while it lasts? because...it won't D: 

hopefully, she meets friends who show her what it truly means to be Taiwanese. she finds a few local haunts where generous aunties know her by name. she discovers a seaside town or natural wonder that she'll revisit with the future kids. husband optional, but preferred. altogether, she'll find a part of this island to call home.

so why the reality distortion field? this all seems cute n' cozy, quite doable. but pursuing new lanes of self-discovery is the gateway drug to both chaos and progress:

>_maybe i really can't do the job and leave the career for good_
>
>_my vanity finsta spirals into a self-obsessed influencer identity_
>
>_bartending on weekends leads to indulging on expensive spirits and even more expensive men_
>
>_I become a [kawaii girl](https://www.ibentoy.com/blog/kawaii-drawings)...?! (alright now we're being a bit absurd >.<)_
>
>
the decision tree permutations are endless.  

if you're a returning reader, you'll remember that I had a shite 2023. so I've decided that when life gives you lemons...question everything.

always my best,

emily

*\*in taiwan, most companies allot 1 hour for lunch...but don't pay you for it. many people use this time to take naps (also customary in the K-12 school schedule) and enjoy their daily diabetic dose of boba.*

hi pals,
<br>
<br>

please know that this ~~email~~ letter is a rarely vulnerable moment from a publicly insensitive boomer so pls handle with care. I'm old and emotionally fragile. 

I'm reaching out because 

a) I've appreciated the depth+dimension of our conversations but 

b) I'm moving far away so 

c) I want to try my best to keep having them. 

the hope is that you'll resonate with my updates and respond, rather than the random "how are you?—>(not) too many updates" texting game while we're oceans apart. feel free to reply any way-writing, voice memo, pitch black video taken in an unidentifiable alley. I'm game. hope you'll come along for the ride? I can start. 

I'm moving to taipei in a week. I've gotten different reactions to the news: 

>_whoaaa...that's wild bro_
>
>_That's huge! I'm so excited for you._
>
>_Are you sure? Why?_
>
>_You don't have any clue what you're doing._
>
>_Oh wow, I had no idea. When are you leaving?_

this isn't arbitrary noise; it's the response from the people I've most wanted (and needed) to update. I’ve intentionally blocked most of it out because for me, this is **point blank** the most consequential and least calculated decision I've made in my life. y'all know how I love to Calculate. Evaluate. Predict. but after the 2023 I've had, I laugh (helplessly) at the concept of controlling your life. To self-dictate one's future is not only an absurd ideal but an unactualized** way of living.

the thing is, I already miss my american homies - the day onesies, the close classmates, and the fascinating introspectators** who I’ve found and kept close. I'll need your trans-pacific visits, stateside updates, and virtual hugs. it's quite lonely where I'm going, at least for a while.

I'm excited to meet my other half: the emily who can speak fluent mandarin with sarcastic undertones and knows how to attract rather than approach. I'm just as excited to share her along the way - with you. I actually think this software update is going to be a good one.

always my best,

emily
