hi friends,

please know that this ~~email~~ letter is a rarely vulnerable moment from a publicly insensitive boomer so pls handle with care. I'm old and emotionally fragile. 

I'm reaching out because 

a) I've appreciated the depth+dimension of our conversations but 

b) I'm moving far away so 

c) I want to try my best to keep having them. 

the hope is that you'll resonate with my updates and respond, rather than the random "how are you?—>(not) too many updates" texting game while we're oceans apart. feel free to reply any way-writing, voice memo, pitch black video taken in an unidentifiable alley. I'm game. hope you'll come along for the ride? I can start. 

I'm moving to taipei in a week. I've gotten different reactions to the news: 

>_whoaaa...that's wild bro_
>
>_That's huge! I'm so excited for you._
>
>_Are you sure? Why?_
>
>_You don't have any clue what you're doing._
>
>_Oh wow, I had no idea. When are you leaving?_

this isn't arbitrary noise; it's the response from the people I've most wanted (and needed) to update. I’ve intentionally blocked most of it out because for me, this is **point blank** the most consequential and least calculated decision I've made in my life. y'all know how I love to Calculate. Evaluate. Predict. but after the 2023 I've had, I laugh (helplessly) at the concept of controlling your life. To self-dictate one's future is not only an absurd ideal but an unactualized** way of living.

the thing is, I already miss my american homies - the day onesies, the close classmates, and the fascinating introspectators** who I’ve found and kept close. I'll need your trans-pacific visits, stateside updates, and virtual hugs. it's quite lonely where I'm going, at least for a while.

I'm excited to meet my other half: the emily who can speak fluent mandarin with sarcastic undertones and knows how to attract rather than approach. I'm just as excited to share her along the way - with you. I actually think this software update is going to be a good one.

always my best,

emily
